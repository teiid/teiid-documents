= Execution Properties

Execution properties may be set on a per statement basis through the `{{ book.productnameFull }}Statement` interface or on the connection via the link:SET_Statement.adoc[SET Statement]. For convenience, the property keys are defined by constants on the `org.teiid.jdbc.ExecutionProperties` interface.
