= Installing the ODBC Driver Client

A PostgreSQL ODBC driver needed to make the ODBC connection to Teiid is _not_ bundled with the Teiid distribution. The appropriate driver needs be http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/[downloaded] directly from the PostgreSQL web site. The _8.04.200_ version of the ODBC driver was extensively tested for compatibility.

== Microsoft Windows

1.  Download at least the ODBC 8.4 driver from the http://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/odbc/versions/msi[PostgreSQL download site]. If you are looking for 64-bit Windows driver download the driver from http://code.google.com/p/visionmap/wiki/psqlODBC[here]. Later versions of the driver may be used the 9.0-9.5 clients have been used extensively by the Teiid community.  There are no active issues against 9.6 and later, but they have not yet seen as much use - if you encounter an issue, please create a JIRA.
2.  Extract the contents of the ZIP file into a temporary location on your system. For example: "c:\temp\pgodbc"
3.  Double click on "psqlodbc.msi" file or (.exe file in the case of 64 bit) to start installation of the driver.
4.  The Wizard appears as

== Other *nix Platform Installations

For all other platforms other than Microsoft Windows, the ODBC driver needs built from the source files provided. Download the ODBC driver source files from http://wwwmaster.postgresql.org/download/mirrors-ftp/odbc/versions/src/psqlodbc-08.04.0200.tar.gz[the PostgreSQL download site]. Untar the files to a temporary location. For example: "~/tmp/pgodbc". Build and install the driver by running the commands below.

NOTE: You should use super user account or use "sudo" command for running the "make install" command.

----
% tar -zxvf psqlodbc-xx.xx.xxxx.tar.gz
% cd psqlodbc-xx.xx.xxxx
% ./configure
% make
% make install
----

Some *nix distributions may already provide binary forms of the appropriate driver, which can be used as an alternative to building from source.
