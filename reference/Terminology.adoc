* VM or Process – a JBossAS instance running Teiid.  

* Host – a machine that is ``hosting'' one or more VMs.

* Service – a subsystem running in a VM (often in many VMs) and providing a  related set of functionality. In addition to these main components, the service platform provides a core set of services available to applications built on top of the service platform.  These services are:

* Session – the Session service manages active session information.

* Buffer Manager – the link:Data_Management.adoc#_buffer_management[Buffer Manager] service provides access to data management for intermediate results.

* Transaction – the Transaction service manages global, local, and request scoped transactions.  See also the documentation on link:Transaction_Support.adoc[Transaction Support].
