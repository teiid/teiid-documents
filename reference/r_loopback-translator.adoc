= Loopback translator

The Loopback translator, known by the type name _loopback_, provides a quick testing solution. 
It supports all SQL constructs and returns default results, with some configurable behavior.

.Execution properties 

|===
|Name |Description |Default

|ThrowError
|`true` to always throw an error.
|false

|RowCount
|Rows returned for non-update queries.
|1

|WaitTime
|Wait randomly up to this number of milliseconds with each source query.
|0

|PollIntervalInMilli
|If positive, results will be `asynchronously` returned -- that is a `DataNotAvailableException` will be thrown initially and 
the engine will wait the poll interval before polling for the results.
|-1

|DelegateName
|Set to the name of the translator which is to be mimicked.
|na 

|===

You can also use the Loopback translator to mimic how a real source query would be formed for a given translator 
(although loopback will still return dummy data that might not be useful for your situation). 
To enable this behavior, set the `DelegateName` property to the name of the translator that you want to mimic. 
For example, to disable all capabilities, set the `DelegateName` property to `jdbc-simple`.
