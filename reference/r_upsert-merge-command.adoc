= UPSERT (MERGE) command

The UPSERT (or MERGE) command is used to add or update records. 
The non-ANSI version of UPSERT that is implemented in {{ book.productnameFull }} is a modified INSERT statement
that requires that the target table has a primary key, and that the target columns cover the primary key. 
Before it performs an INSERT, the UPSERT operation checks whether a row exists, 
and if it does, UPSERT updates the current row rather than inserting a new one.

.Example syntax

[source,sql]
----
UPSERT INTO table [[AS] alias] (column,...) VALUES (value,...)
----

[source,sql]
----
UPSERT INTO table (column,...) query
----

.UPSERT pushdown
NOTE: If an UPSERT statement is not pushed to the source, it is broken down into the respective insert/update operations, 
which requires XA support on the target system to guarantee atomicity.
