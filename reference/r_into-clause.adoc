= INTO clause

WARNING: Usage of the INTO Clause for inserting into a table has been been deprecated. 
An INSERT with a query command should be used instead. For information about using INSERT, see xref:insert-command[INSERT command].

{% if book.targetSpring or book.targetWildfly %}
When the into clause is specified with a SELECT, the results of the query are inserted into the specified table. 
This is often used to insert records into a temporary table. The INTO clause immediately precedes the FROM clause.

.Usage

[source,sql]
----
INTO table FROM ...
----

.Syntax rules

* The `INTO` clause is logically applied last in processing, after the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses.

* {{ book.productnameFull }}â€™s support for `SELECT INTO` is similar to Microsoft SQL Server. 
The target of the `INTO` clause is a table where the result of the `SELECT` command will be inserted. 
+
For example, the following statement:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT col1, col2 INTO targetTable FROM sourceTable
----
+
inserts `col1` and `col2` from the `sourceTable` into the `targetTable`.  
* You cannot combine SELECT INTO with a UNION query.
+
That is, you cannot select the results from a `sourceTable UNION` query for insertion 
into a `targetTable`.
