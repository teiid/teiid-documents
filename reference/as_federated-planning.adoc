= Federated Planning

At its core, {{ book.productnameFull }} is a federated, relational query engine. 
This query engine allows you to treat all of your data sources as one virtual database, and access them through a single SQL query. 
As a result, instead of focusing on hand-coding joins, you can focus on building your application, and on running other relational operations between data sources.
