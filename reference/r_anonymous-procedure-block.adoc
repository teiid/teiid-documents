= Anonymous procedure block

You can execute a procedure language block as a user command. 
This can be an advantage in situations in which a virtual procedure does not exist, but a set of processes can be carried out on the server side.
For more information about the language for defining virtual procedures, see xref:procedure-language[Procedure language].

.Example syntax

[source,sql]
----
begin insert into pm1.g1 (e1, e2) select ?, ?; select rowcount; end;
----

.Syntax rules
* You can use `in` parameters with prepared/callable statement parameters, as shown in the preceding example, which uses `?` parameter.
* You cannot use `out` parameters in an anonymous procedure block. 
As a workaround, you can use session variables as needed.
* Anonymous procedure blocks do not return data as output parameters.
* A single result is returned if any of the statements returns a result set. 
All returnable result sets must have a matching number of columns and types. 
To indicate that a statement is not intended to provide a result set, use the WITHOUT RETURN clause.
