[id="access-patterns"]
.Access patterns

Access patterns are used on both physical tables and views to specify the need for criteria against a set of columns. 
Failure to supply the criteria will result in a planning error, rather than a run-away source query. 
Access patterns can be applied in a set such that only one of the access patterns is required to be satisfied.

Currently any form of criteria referencing an affected column may satisfy an access pattern.

.Pushdown

In federated database systems pushdown refers to decomposing the user level query into source queries that 
perform as much work as possible on their respective source system. Pushdown analysis requires knowledge 
of source system capabilities, which is provided to {{ book.productnameFull }} though the Connector API. 
Any work not performed at the source is then processed in Federateâ€™s relational engine.

Based upon capabilities, {{ book.productnameFull }} will manipulate the query plan to ensure that 
each source performs as much joining, filtering, grouping, and so forth, as possible. In many cases, such as with 
join ordering, planning is a combination of xref:standard-relational-techniques[standard relational techniques] 
along with costing information, and heuristics for pushdown optimization.

Criteria and join push down are typically the most important aspects of the query to push down 
when performance is a concern. For information about how to read a plan to ensure that source queries are as efficient as possible, 
see xref:query-plans[Query plans].

.Dependent joins

A special optimization called a dependent join is used to reduce the rows returned from one of 
the two relations involved in a multi-source join. 
In a dependent join, queries are issued to each source sequentially rather than in parallel, with 
the results obtained from the first source used to restrict the records returned from the second. 
Dependent joins can perform some joins much faster by drastically reducing the amount of data retrieved 
from the second source and the number of join comparisons that must be performed.

The conditions when a dependent join is used are determined by the query planner based on 
xref:access-patterns[access patterns], hints, and costing information. 
You can use the following types of dependent joins with {{ book.productnameFull }}:

Join based on equality or inequality:: Where the engine determines how to break up large 
queries based on translator capabilities.
Key pushdown:: Where the translator has access to the full set of key values and determines 
what queries to send.
Full pushdown:: Where the translator ships the all data from the independent side to the translator. 
Can be used automatically by costing or can be specified as an option in the hint.

You can use the following types of hints in {{ book.productnameFull }} to control dependent join behavior:

MAKEIND:: Indicates that the clause should be the independent side of a dependent join.
MAKEDEP:: Indicates that the clause should be the dependent side of a join. As a non-comment 
hint, you can use `MAKEDEP` with the following optional `MAX` and `JOIN` arguments. 
MAKEDEP(JOIN)::: meaning that the entire join should be pushed. 
MAKEDEP(MAX:5000)::: meaning that the dependent join should only be performed if there are less than 
the maximum number of values from the independent side.
MAKENOTDEP:: Prevents the clause from being the dependent side of a join.

These can be placed in either the xref:option-clause[OPTION Clause] or directly in the 
xref:from-clause[FROM Clause]. As long as all xref:access-patterns[Access Patterns] 
can be met, the MAKEIND, MAKEDEP, and MAKENOTDEP hints override any use of costing information. MAKENOTDEP supersedes the other hints.

TIP: The MAKEDEP or MAKEIND hints should only be used if the proper query plan is not chosen by default. 
You should ensure that your costing information is representative of the actual source cardinality. 

NOTE: An inappropriate MAKEDEP or MAKEIND hint can force an inefficient join structure and may result 
in many source queries.

TIP: While these hints can be applied to views, the optimizer will by default remove views when possible. 
This can result in the hint placement being significantly different than the original intention. 
You should consider using the NO_UNNEST hint to prevent the optimizer from removing the view in these cases.

In the simplest scenario the engine will use IN clauses (or just equality predicates) to filter the values coming from the dependent side. 
If the number of values from the independent side exceeds the translators `MaxInCriteriaSize`, the values 
will be split into multiple IN predicates up to `MaxDependentPredicates`. 
When the number of independent values exceeds `MaxInCriteriaSize*MaxDependentPredicates`, 
then multiple dependent queries will be issued in parallel.

If the translator returns true for `supportsDependentJoins`, then the engine may provide the entire set of 
independent key values.  This will occur when the number of independent values exceeds 
`MaxInCriteriaSize*MaxDependentPredicates` so that the translator may use specific logic to avoid issuing 
multiple queries as would happen in the simple scenario.

If the translator returns true for both `supportsDependentJoins` and `supportsFullDependentJoins` then 
a full pushdown may be chosen by the optimizer  A full pushdown, sometimes also called as data-ship pushdown, 
is where all the data from independent side of the join is sent to dependent side. This has an added 
benefit of allowing the plan above the join to be eligible for pushdown as well.
This is why the optimizer may choose to perform a full pushdown even when the number of independent values 
does not exceed `MaxInCriteriaSize*MaxDependentPredicates`.  You may also force full pushdown using the `MAKEDEP(JOIN)` hint.
The translator is typically responsible for creating, populating, and removing a temporary table that 
represents the independent side. For more information about how to use custom translators with dependent, key, 
and full pushdown, see _Dependent join pushdown_ in link:../dev/Dependent_Join_Pushdown.adoc[Translator Development].
//link to Translator Development guide 
NOTE: By default, *Key/Full Pushdown* is compatible with only a subset of JDBC translators. 
To use it, set the translator override property `enableDependentJoins` to `true`. 
The JDBC source must allow for the creation of temporary tables, which typically requires a Hibernate dialect. 
The following translators are compatible with this feature: DB2, Derby, H2, Hana, HSQL, MySQL, Oracle, 
PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SAP IQ, Sybase, Teiid, and Teradata. 


.Copy criteria

Copy criteria is an optimization that creates additional predicates based upon combining join and where clause criteria. 
For example, equi-join predicates ``(source1.table.column = source2.table.column)`` are used to create 
new predicates by substituting `source1.table.column` for `source2.table.column` and vice versa. 
In a cross-source scenario, this allows for where criteria applied to a single side of the join to be applied to both source queries

.Projection minimization

{{ book.productnameFull }} ensures that each pushdown query only projects the symbols required 
for processing the user query. This is especially helpful when querying through large intermediate view layers.

[id="partial-aggregate-pushdown"]
.Partial aggregate pushdown

Partial aggregate pushdown allows for grouping operations above multi-source joins and unions 
to be decomposed so that some of the grouping and aggregate functions may be pushed down to the sources.

.Optional join

An optional or redundant join is one that can be removed by the optimizer. 
The optimizer will automatically remove inner joins based upon a foreign key or left outer joins when the outer results are unique.

The optional join hint goes beyond the automatic cases to indicate to the optimizer that a joined table 
should be omitted if none of its columns are used by the output of the user query or in a meaningful 
way to construct the results of the user query. This hint is typically only used in view layers containing multi-source joins.

The optional join hint is applied as a comment on a join clause. It can be applied in both ANSI and 
non-ANSI joins. With non-ANSI joins an entire joined table may be marked as optional.

[source,sql]
.*Example: Optional join hint*
----
select a.column1, b.column2 from a, /*+ optional */ b WHERE a.key = b.key
----

Suppose this example defines a view layer `X`. If `X` is queried in such a way as to not need `b.column2`, 
then the optional join hint will cause `b` to be omitted from the query plan. The result would be the same as if `X` were defined as:

[source,sql]
.*Example: Optional join hint*
----
select a.column1 from a
----

[source,sql]
.*Example: ANSI optional join hint*
----
select a.column1, b.column2, c.column3 from /*+ optional */ (a inner join b ON a.key = b.key) INNER JOIN c ON a.key = c.key
----

In this example the ANSI join syntax allows for the join of a and b to be marked as optional. 
Suppose this example defines a view layer X. Only if both `column a.column1` and `b.column2` are not needed, 
for example, `SELECT column3 FROM X` will the join be removed.

The optional join hint will not remove a bridging table that is still required.

[source,sql]
.*Example: Bridging table*
----
select a.column1, b.column2, c.column3 from /*+ optional */ a, b, c WHERE ON a.key = b.key AND a.key = c.key
----

Suppose this example defines a view layer `X`. If `b.column2` or `c.column3` are solely required by a query to `X`, 
then the join on a be removed. However if `a.column1` or both `b.column2` and `c.column3` are needed, 
then the optional join hint will not take effect.

When a join clause is omitted via the optional join hint, the relevant criteria is not applied. 
Thus it is possible that the query results may not have the same cardinality or even the same row values as when the join is fully applied.

Left/right outer joins where the inner side values are not used and whose rows under go a distinct 
operation will automatically be treated as an optional join and do not require a hint.

[source,sql]
.*Example: Unnecessary optional join hint*
----
    select distinct a.column1 from a LEFT OUTER JOIN /*+optional*/ b ON a.key = b.key
----

NOTE: A simple "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM VIEW" against a view where all join tables are marked as optional will not return a meaningful result.

.Source hints

{{ book.productnameFull }} user and transformation queries can contain a meta source hint that 
can provide additional information to source queries. The source hint has the following form:

[source,sql]
----
/*+ sh[[ KEEP ALIASES]:'arg'] source-name[ KEEP ALIASES]:'arg1' ... */
----

* The source hint is expected to appear after the query (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) keyword.
* Source hints can appear in any subquery, or in views. All hints applicable to a given source query 
will be collected and pushed down together as a list. The order of the hints is not guaranteed.
* The sh arg is optional and is passed to all source queries via the `ExecutionContext.getGeneralHints` method. 
The additional args should have a source-name that matches the source name assigned to the translator in the VDB. 
If the source-name matches, the hint values will be supplied via the `ExecutionContext.getSourceHints` method. 
For more information about using an ExecutionContext, see link:../dev/Translator_Development.adoc[Translator Development] .
* Each of the arg values has the form of a string literal - it must be surrounded in single quotes 
and a single quote can be escaped with another single quote. Only the Oracle translator does anything 
with source hints by default. The Oracle translator will use both the source hint and 
the general hint (in that order) if available to form an Oracle hint enclosed in `/*+ â€¦ */`.
* If the KEEP ALIASES option is used either for the general hint or on the applicable source specific hint, 
then the table/view aliases from the user query and any nested views will be preserved in the push-down query. 
This is useful in situations where the source hint may need to reference aliases and the user does not 
wish to rely on the generated aliases (which can be seen in the query plan in the relevant source queries -- see above). 
However in some situations this may result in an invalid source query if the preserved alias names 
are not valid for the source or result in a name collision. If the usage of KEEP ALIASES results in an error, 
the query could be modified by preventing view removal with the NO_UNNEST hint, the aliases modified, 
or the KEEP ALIASES option could be removed and the query plan used to determine the generated alias names.

[source,sql]
.*Sample source hints*
----
SELECT /*+ sh:'general hint' */ ... 

SELECT /*+ sh KEEP ALIASES:'general hint' my-oracle:'oracle hint' */ ... 
----

.Partitioned union

Union partitioning is inferred from the transformation/inline view. If one (or more) of the UNION columns 
is defined by constants and/or has WHERE clause IN predicates containing only constants that make 
each branch mutually exclusive, then the UNION is considered partitioned. 
UNION ALL must be used and the UNION cannot have a LIMIT, WITH, or ORDER BY clause (although individual 
  branches may use LIMIT, WITH, or ORDER BY). Partitioning values should not be null.

[source,sql]
.*Example: Partitioned union*
----
create view part as select 1 as x, y from foo union all select z, a from foo1 where z in (2, 3)
----

The view is partitioned on column x, since the first branch can only be the value 1 and the second branch can only be the values 2 or 3.
 
NOTE: More advanced or explicit partitioning will be considered for future releases. 

The concept of a partitioned union is used for performing partition-wise joins, in 
xref:updatable-views[Updatable Views], and xref:partial-aggregate-pushdown[Partial Aggregate Pushdown].
These optimizations are also applied when using the multi-source feature as well - 
which introduces an explicit partitioning column.

Partition-wise joins take a join of unions and convert the plan into a union of joins, 
such that only matching partitions are joined against one another.  
//See also http://blog.everythingjboss.info/articles/Partitioned-Union-JDV/[a blog on the join optimization].
//Preceding link seems to be dead-end.
If you want a partition-wise join to be performed implicit without the need for an 
explicit join predicate on the partitioning column, set the model/schema property 
`implicit_partition.columnName` to name of the partitioning column used on each partitioned view in the model/schema.

[source,xml]
----
CREATE VIRTUAL SCHEMA all_customers SERVER server OPTIONS ("implicit_partition.columnName" 'theColumn');
----

{% if book.targetWildfly %}
In an XML VDB:
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<vdb name="partition" version="1">
    <model name="all_customers" type="VIRTUAL">
        <property name="implicit_partition.columnName" value="theColumn"/>
    ...
----  
{% endif %}

[id="standard-relational-techniques"]
.Standard relational techniques

{{ book.productnameFull }} also incorporates many standard relational techniques to ensure efficient query plans.

* Rewrite analysis for function simplification and evaluation.
* Boolean optimizations for basic criteria simplification.
* Removal of unnecessary view layers.
* Removal of unnecessary sort operations.
* Advanced search techniques through the left-linear space of join trees.
* Parallelizing of source access during execution.
* xref:subquery-optimization[Subquery optimization].

.Join compensation

Some source systems only allow "relationship" queries logically producing left outer join results.
Even when queried with an inner join, {{ book.productnameFull }} will attempt to form an appropriate left outer join. 
These sources are restricted to use with key joins. In some circumstances foreign key relationships 
on the same source should not be traversed at all or with the referenced table on the outer side of join. 
The extension property `teiid_rel:allow-join` can be used on the foreign key to further restrict 
the pushdown behavior. With a value of "false" no join pushdown will be allowed, and with a value 
of "inner" the referenced table must be on the inner side of the join. If the join pushdown is prevented, 
the join will be processed as a federated join.
