= JSONTABLE

The JSONTABLE function uses link:https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath[JsonPath] to produce tabular output. 
The JSONTABLE function is implicitly a nested table and can be used within FROM clauses.

.Usage

[source,sql]
----
JSONTABLE(value, path [, nullLeafOnMissing] COLUMNS <COLUMN>, ... ) AS name
----

[source,sql]
----
COLUMN := name (FOR ORDINALITY | (datatype [PATH string]))
----

See also xref:jsonpath[JsonPath]

.Parameters

value:: A clob containing a valid JSON document. 

nullLeafOnMissing:: If false (the default), then a path that evaluates to a leaf that is missing will throw an exception. 
If nullLeafOnMissing is true, then a null value will be returned.

PATH::: String should be a valid JsonPath. 
If an array value is returned, then each non-null element will be used to generate a row. 
Otherwise a single non-null item will be used to create a single row.

FOR ORDINALITY:: Column typed as integer. Returns a 1-based item number as its value.

* Each non-ordinality column specifies a type and optionally a PATH.

* If PATH is not specified, then the path will be generated from the column name: @['name'], 
which will look for an object key value matching name. 
If PATH is specified, it must begin with @, which means that the path will be processed relative the the current row context item.

.Syntax Rules

* Columns names must not contain duplicates.

* You cannot use array types with the JSONTABLE function.

.JSONTABLE examples

Use of passing, returns 1 row [1]:

[source,sql]
----
select * from jsontable('{"a": {"id":1}}}', '$.a' COLUMNS id integer) x
----

As a nested table:

[source,sql]
----
select x.* from t, jsontable(t.doc, '$.x.y' COLUMNS first string, second FOR ORDINALITY) x
----

With more complicated paths:

[source,sql]
----
select x.* from jsontable('[{"firstName": "John", "lastName": "Wayne", "children": []}, {"firstName": "John", "lastName": "Adams", "children":["Sue","Bob"]}]', '$.*' COLUMNS familyName string path '@.lastName', children integer path '@.children.length()' ) x
----

.Differences with XMLTABLE

Processing of JSON to tabular results was previously recommended through the use of XMLTABLE with JSONTOXML. 
For most tasks, JSONTABLE provides a simpler syntax. However, there are some differences to consider:

* JSONTABLE parses the JSON completely, the processes it. 
XMLTABLE uses streaming processing to reduce the memory overhead.
* JsonPath is not as powerful as XQuery. 
There are a lot of functions and operations available in XQuery/XPath that are not available in JsonPath.
* JsonPath does not allow for parent references in the column paths. 
There is no ability to reference the root or any part of the parent hierarchy (.. in XPath).
