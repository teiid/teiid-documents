= Choice Functions

Choice functions provide a way to select from two values based on some characteristic of one of the values.

|===
|Function |Definition |Datatype Constraint

|COALESCE(x,y+)
|Returns the first non-null parameter
|x and all y’s can be any compatible types

|IFNULL(x,y)
|If x is null, return y; else return x
|x, y, and the return type must be the same type but can be any type

|NVL(x,y)
|If x is null, return y; else return x
|x, y, and the return type must be the same type but can be any type

|NULLIF(param1, param2)
|Equivalent to case when (param1 = param2) then null else param1
|param1 and param2 must be compatable comparable types
|===

IFNULL and NVL are aliases of each other. They are the same function.
