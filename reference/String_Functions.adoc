= String Functions

String functions generally take strings as inputs and return strings as outputs.

Unless specified, all of the arguments and return types in the following table are strings and all indexes are 1-based. The 0 index is considered to be before the start of the string.

|===
|Function |Definition |Datatype Constraint

|x \|\| y
|Concatenation operator
|x,y in {string, clob}, return type is string or clob

|ASCII(x)
|Provide ASCII value of the left most character in x. The empty string will as input will return null.
|return type is integer

|CHR(x) CHAR(x)
|Provide the character for ASCII value x [a]
|x in {integer}

|CONCAT(x, y)
|Concatenates x and y with ANSI semantics. If x and/or y is null, returns null.
|x, y in {string}

|CONCAT2(x, y)
|Concatenates x and y with non-ANSI null semantics. If x and y is null, returns null. If only x or y is null, returns the other value.
|x, y in {string}

|ENDSWITH(x, y)
|Checks if y ends with x. If x or y is null, returns null.
|x, y in {string}, returns boolean

|INITCAP(x)
|Make first letter of each word in string x capital and all others lowercase
|x in {string}

|INSERT(str1, start, length, str2)
|Insert string2 into string1
|str1 in {string}, start in {integer}, length in {integer}, str2 in {string}

|LCASE(x)
|Lowercase of x
|x in {string}

|LEFT(x, y)
|Get left y characters of x
|x in {string}, y in {integer}, return string

|LENGTH(x) CHAR_LENGTH(x) CHARACTER_LENGTH(x)
|Length of x
|return type is integer

|LOCATE(x, y) POSITION(x IN y)
|Find position of x in y starting at beginning of y
|x in {string}, y in {string}, return integer

|LOCATE(x, y, z)
|Find position of x in y starting at z
|x in {string}, y in {string}, z in {integer}, return integer

|LPAD(x, y)
|Pad input string x with spaces on the left to the length of y
|x in {string}, y in {integer}, return string

|LPAD(x, y, z)
|Pad input string x on the left to the length of y using character z
|x in {string}, y in {string}, z in {character}, return string

|LTRIM(x)
|Left trim x of blank chars
|x in {string}, return string

|QUERYSTRING(path [, expr [AS name] …])
|Returns a properly encoded query string appended to the given path. Null valued expressions are omitted, and a null path is treated as ". Names are optional for column reference expressions.e.g. `QUERYSTRING('path', 'value' as "&x", ' & ' as y, null as z) returns 'path?%26x=value&y=%20%26%20'`
|path, expr in {string}. name is an identifier

|REPEAT(str1,instances)
|Repeat string1 a specified number of times
|str1 in {string}, instances in {integer} return string

|RIGHT(x, y)
|Get right y characters of x
|x in {string}, y in {integer}, return string

|RPAD(input string x, pad length y)
|Pad input string x with spaces on the right to the length of y
|x in {string}, y in {integer}, return string

|RPAD(x, y, z)
|Pad input string x on the right to the length of y using character z
|x in {string}, y in {string}, z in {character}, return string

|RTRIM(x)
|Right trim x of blank chars
|x is string, return string

|SPACE(x)
|Repeat the space character x number of times
|x is integer, return string

|SUBSTRING(x, y) SUBSTRING(x FROM y)
|[b] Get substring from x, from position y to the end of x
|y in {integer}

|SUBSTRING(x, y, z) SUBSTRING(x FROM y FOR z)
|[b] Get substring from x from position y with length z
|y, z in {integer}

|TRANSLATE(x, y, z)
|Translate string x by replacing each character in y with the character in z at the same position
|x in {string}

|TRIM([[LEADING\|TRAILING\|BOTH] [x] FROM] y)
|Trim the leading, trailing, or both ends of a string y of character x. If LEADING/TRAILING/BOTH is not specified, BOTH is used. If no trim character x is specficed then the blank space `' is used.
|x in {character}, y in {string}

|UCASE(x)
|Uppercase of x
|x in {string}

|UNESCAPE(x)
|Unescaped version of x. Possible escape sequences are \b - backspace, \t - tab, \n - line feed, \f - form feed, \r - carriage return. \uXXXX, where X is a hex value, can be used to specify any unicode character. \XXX, where X is an octal digit, can be used to specify an octal byte value. If any other character appears after an escape character, that character will appear in the output and the escape character will be ignored.
|x in {string}

[a] Non-ASCII range characters or integers used in these functions may produce different results or exceptions depending on where the function is evaluated (Teiid vs. source). Teiid’s uses Java default int to char and char to int conversions, which operates over UTF16 values.

[b] The substring function depending upon the source does not have consistent behavior with respect to negative from/length arguments nor out of bounds from/length arguments. The default Teiid behavior is:

* return a null value when the from value is out of bounds or the length is less than 0
* a zero from index is effective the same as 1.
* a negative from index is first counted from the end of the string.

Some sources however can return an empty string instead of null and some sources do not support negative indexing. If any of these inconsistencies impact you, then please log an issue.

== Encoding Functions

=== TO_CHARS

Return a clob from the blob with the given encoding.

[source,sql]
----
TO_CHARS(x, encoding [, wellformed])
----

BASE64, HEX, and the built-in Java Charset names are valid values for the encoding [b]. x is a blob, encoding is a string, wellformed is a boolean, and returns a clob. The two argument form defaults to wellformed=true. If wellformed is false, the conversion function will immediately validate the result such that an unmappable character or malformed input will raise an exception.

=== TO_BYTES

Return a blob from the clob with the given encoding.

[source,sql]
----
TO_BYTES(x, encoding [, wellformed])
----

BASE64, HEX, and the builtin Java Charset names are valid values for the encoding [b]. x in a clob, encoding is a string, wellformed is a boolean and returns a blob. The two argument form defaults to wellformed=true. If wellformed is false, the conversion function will immediately validate the result such that an unmappable character or malformed input will raise an exception. If wellformed is true, then unmappable characters will be replaced by the default replacement character for the character set. Binary formats, such as BASE64 and HEX, will be checked for correctness regardless of the wellformed parameter.

[b] See the http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/nio/charset/Charset.html[Charset JavaDoc] for more on supported Charset names.

== Replacement Functions

=== REPLACE

Replace all occurrences of a given string with another.

[source,sql]
----
REPLACE(x, y, z)
----

Replace all occurrences of y with z in x. x, y, z are strings and the return value is a string.

=== REGEXP_REPLACE

Replace one or all occurrences of a given pattern with another string.

[source,sql]
----
REGEXP_REPLACE(str, pattern, sub [, flags])
----

Replace one or more occurrences of pattern with sub in str. All arguments are strings and the return value is a string.

The pattern parameter is expected to be a valid http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Java Regular Expression]

The flags argument can be any concatenation of any of the valid flags with the following meanings:

|===
|flag |name |meaning

|g
|global
|Replace all occurrences, not just the first

|m
|multiline
|Match over multiple lines

|i
|case insensitive
|Match without case sensitivity
|===

Usage:

The following will return "xxbye Wxx" using the global and case insensitive options.

[source,sql]

----
regexp_replace('Goodbye World', '[g-o].', 'x', 'gi')
