.Canceling queries

When a query is canceled, processing will be stopped in the query engine and in all 
connectors involved in the query. The semantics of what a connector does in response 
to a cancellation command depends on the connector implementation. For example, 
JDBC connectors will asynchronously call cancel on the underlying JDBC driver, which 
might or might not support this method.

.User query timeouts

User query timeouts in {{ book.productnameFull }} can be managed on the client-side 
or the server-side. Timeouts are only relevant for the first record returned. 
If the first record has not been received by the client within the specified timeout period, 
a `cancel` command is issued to the server for the request and no results are returned 
to the client. The cancel command is issued asynchronously without the clientâ€™s intervention.

The JDBC API uses the query timeout set by the `java.sql.Statement.setQueryTimeout` method. 
You can also set a default statement timeout via the connection property "QUERYTIMEOUT". 
ODBC clients can also use QUERYTIMEOUT as an execution property via a set statement 
to control the default timeout setting. See the Client Developer's Guide for more on 
connection/execution properties and set statements.

Server-side timeouts start when the query is received by the engine. Network latency or server load
can delays the processing of I/O work after a client issues the query. The timeout will 
be cancelled if the first result is sent back before the timeout has ended. 
For more information about setting the `query-timeout` property for a virtual database, 
see xref:vdb-properties[Virtual database properties]. For more information about modifying 
system properties to set a default query timeout for all queries, see _System properties_ 
in the Administrator's Guide.
