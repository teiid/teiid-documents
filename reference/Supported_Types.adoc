= Supported Types

{{ book.productnameFull }} supports a core set of runtime types. Runtime types can be different than semantic types defined in type fields at design time. The runtime type can also be specified at design time or it will be automatically chosen as the closest base type to the semantic type.

|java.sql.Clob [7]
|CLOB
|VARCHAR

|===

NOTE: Even if a type is declared with a length, precision, or scale argument, those restrictions are effectively ignored by the runtime system, but may be enforced/reported at the edge by OData, ODBC, JDBC.  The geospatial types act in a similar manner.  Extension metadata may be needed for srid, type, and number of dimensions for consumption by tools/OData - but it is not yet enforced.  In some instances you may need to use the ST_SETSRID function to ensure the srid is associated.

1. The runtime type is org.teiid.core.types.BinaryType. Translators will need to explicitly handle BinaryType values. UDFs will instead have a byte[] value passed. 
2. The concrete type is expected to be org.teiid.core.types.BlobType 
3. The concrete type is expected to be org.teiid.core.types.ClobType 
4. The concrete type is expected to be org.teiid.core.types.XMLType 
5. The concrete type is expected to be org.teiid.core.types.GeometryType
6. The concrete type is expected to be org.teiid.core.types.GeographyType
3. The concrete type is expected to be org.teiid.core.types.JsonType

== Arrays

WARNING: {{ book.productnameFull }}’s support for arrays is a new feature as of the 8.5 release. Support will be refined and enhanced in subsequent releases.

An array of any type is designated by adding [] for each array dimension
to the type declaration.

Example array types:

[source,sql]
----
string[]
----

[source,sql]
----
integer[][]
----

NOTE: {{ book.productnameFull }} array handling is typically in memory. It is not advisable to rely on the usage of large array values. Also arrays of lobs are not well supported and will typically not be handled correctly when serialized.
