Spatial functions provide functionality for working with http://www.opengeospatial.org/[geospatial] data. 
{{ book.productnameFull }} relies on the http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/JTSHome.htm[JTS Topology Suite] 
to provide partial compatibility with the OpenGIS Simple Features Specification For SQL Revision 1.1. 
For more information about particular functions, see the https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=829[Open GIS specification] 
or the http://postgis.net/docs/manual-2.0/[PostGIS manual].

Most Geometry capabilities is limited to two dimensions due to the WKB and WKT formats.

NOTE: There might be minor differences between {{ book.productnameFull }} and pushdown results that will need to be further refined.
