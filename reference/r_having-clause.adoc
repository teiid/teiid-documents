= HAVING Clause

The `HAVING` clause operates exactly as a `WHERE` clause, although it operates on the output of a `GROUP BY`. 
You can use the same syntax with the `HAVING` clause as with the `WHERE` clause.

.Syntax Rules

* Expressions used in the GROUP BY clause must contain either an aggregate function (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`), or be one of the grouping expressions.
