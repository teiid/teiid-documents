The {{ book.productnameFull }} type system is based on Java/JDBC types.  
The runtime object is represented by the corresponding Java class, such as Long, Integer, Boolean, String, and so forth.
For more information, see xref:supported-types[Runtime types].
You can use domain types to extend the type system. 
For more information, see xref:ddl-metadata-for-domains[DDL metadata for domains].
