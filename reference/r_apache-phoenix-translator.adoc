= Apache Phoenix Translator (phoenix)

Also see common xref:jdbc-translators[JDBC Translators] information.

The Apache Phoenix translator, known by the type name *_phoenix_*, exposes querying functionality to http://hbase.apache.org/[HBase] tables. 
http://phoenix.apache.org/[Apache Phoenix] is a JDBC SQL interface for HBase that is required for this translator as it pushes down commands into 
http://phoenix.apache.org/language/index.html[Phoenix SQL].

The translator is also known by the deprecated name *_hbase_*. 
The name change reflects that the translator is specific to Phoenix and that there could be other translators introduced in the future to connect to HBase.

Do not use the `DatabaseTimezone` property with this translator.

The HBase translator doesnâ€™t support Join commands. 
Phoenix uses the HBase Table Row ID as the Primary Key, which map to . 
This Translator is developed with Phoenix 4.3 or greater for HBase 0.98.1 or greater.

NOTE: The translator implements INSERT/UPDATE through the Phoenix UPSERT operation. 
This means you can see different behavior than with standard INSERT/UPDATE. 
For example, repeated inserts will not throw a duplicate key exception, but will instead update the row in question.

NOTE: Due to Phoenix driver limitations the importer will not look for unique constraints and defaults to not importing foreign keys.

NOTE: The translator supports offset and other features starting with Phoenix 4.8. 
The Phoenix driver hard codes the server version in `PhoenixDatabaseMetaData`, and does not otherwise provide a way to detect the server version at runtime. 
If a newer driver is used with an older server, set the database version translator property manually.

WARNING: The Phoenix driver does not have robust handling of time values. 
If your time values are normalized to use a date component of 1970-01-01, then the default handling will work correctly. 
If not, then the time column should be modeled as timestamp instead.
