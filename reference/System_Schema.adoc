= System Schema

The built-in SYS and SYSADMIN schemas provide metadata tables and procedures against the current VDB.

== Metadata Visibility

The SYS system schema tables and procedures are always visible/accessible.

Unlike Teiid 8.x and prior releases when link:Data_Roles.adoc[Data Roles] are in use table/views and procedure metadata entries will not be visible if the 
user is not entitled to use the object.  Tables/views/columns require the READ permission and procedures require the EXECUTE permission.  All columns of a key
must be accessible for the entry to be visible.  

NOTE: If there is any caching of system metadata when data roles are in use, then visibility needs to be considered.
