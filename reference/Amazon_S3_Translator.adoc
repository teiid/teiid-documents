= Amazon S3 Translator

The Amazon S3 translator, known by the type nameÂ _amazon-s3_, exposes stored procedures to leverage Amazon S3 object resources. The link:../admin/Web_Service_Data_Sources.adoc[Web Service Data Source] resource-adapter will be used for access. This will commonly be used with the TEXTTABLE or XMLTABLE table functions to use CSV or XML formatted data or read excel files, or other object files stored in the Amazon S3. This translator supports access to Amazon S3 using access-key and secret-key. 


== Usage
Here is sample VDB that is reading CSV file from Amazon S3 with name 'g2.txt' in the Amazon S3 bucket called 'teiidbucket'

== Execution Properties
These below properties can be provided using translator override mechanism to supply as default properties.

|===
|Name |Description |Default

|Encoding
|The encoding that should be used for CLOBs returned by the getTextFiles procedure.  The value should match an encoding known to the JRE.
|The system default encoding

|Accesskey
|Amazon Security Access Key. Log in to Amazom console to find your security access key. When provided, this becomes the default access key
|n/a

|Secretkey
|Amazon Security secret Key. Log in to Amazom console to find your security secret key. When provided, this becomes the default secret key.
|n/a

|Region
|Amazon Region to be used with the request. When provided this will be default region used.
|n/a

|Bucket
|Amazon S3 bucket name, if provided this will serve as default bucket to be used for all the requests
|n/a

|Encryption
|When SSE-C type encryption used, where customer supplies the encryption key, this key will be used for defining the "type" of encryption algorithm used. Supported are AES-256, AWS-KMS. If provided this will be used as default algorithm for all "get" based calls
|n/a

|Encryptionkey
|When SSE-C type encryption used, where customer supplies the encryption key, this key will be used for defining the "encryption key". If provided this will be used as default key for all "get" based calls
|n/a

TIP: See link:Translators.adoc#_override_execution_properties[override an execution property] and the example below to set the properties.

== Procedures Exposed by Translator
When you add the a model (schema) like above in the example, the following procedure calls are available for user to execute against Amazon S3.

NOTE: Please note that bucket, region, accesskey, secretkey, encryption and encryptionkey are optional or nullable parameters in most of the methods provided. i.e. user do not need to provide them, if they are already configured using translator override properties as shown in above vdb example.

=== getTextFile(...)

Retrieves the given named object as text file from specified bucket and region using the provided security credentials as clob.

[source,sql]
----
getTextFile(string name NOT NULL, string bucket, string region, 
   string endpoint, string accesskey, string secretkey,string encryption, string encryptionkey) 
   returns TABLE(file blob, endpoint string, lastModified string, etag string, size long);
----

NOTE: endpoint property is optional, when provided the this URL will be used instead of the one constructed by the supplied properties. Use encryption and encryptionkey only in when server side security with customer supplied keys (SSE-C) in force.   

==== examples
[source,sql] 
----
exec getTextFile(name=>'myfile.txt');

SELECT SP.e1, SP.e2,SP.e3, f.lastmodified 
   FROM (EXEC getTextFile(name=>'myfile.txt')) AS f,
   TEXTTABLE(f.file COLUMNS e1 integer, e2 string, e3 double HEADER) AS SP; 	
----

=== getFile(...)
Retrieves the given named object as binary file from specified bucket and region using the provided security credentials as blob.

[source,sql]
----
getFile(string name NOT NULL, string bucket, string region, 
   string endpoint, string accesskey, string secretkey, string encryption, string encryptionkey) 
   returns TABLE(file blob, endpoint string, lastModified string, etag string, size long)
----

NOTE: endpoint property is optional, when provided the this URL will be used instead of the one constructed by the supplied properties. Use encryption and encryptionkey only in when server side security with customer supplied keys (SSE-C) in force.   

==== examples
[source,sql] 
----
exec getFile(name=>'myfile.xml', bucket=>'mybucket', region=>'us-east-1', accesskey=>'xxxx', secretkey=>'xxxx');

select b.* from (exec getFile(name=>'myfile.xml', bucket=>'mybucket', region=>'us-east-1', accesskey=>'xxxx', secretkey=>'xxxx')) as a, 
XMLTABLE('/contents' PASSING XMLPARSE(CONTENT a.result WELLFORMED) COLUMNS e1 integer, e2 string, e3 double) as b;	
----

=== saveFile(...)

Save the CLOB, BLOB, or XML value to given name and bucket. In the below procedure signature _contents_ parameter can be any of the lob types.

[source,sql]
----
call saveFile(string name NOT NULL, string bucket, string region, string endpoint, 
   string accesskey, string secretkey, contents object)
----

NOTE: currently _saveFile_ does NOT support streaming/chuncked based upload of the contents. i.e. if you try to load very large objects there is risk of reaching out of memory issues. This method does not support SSE-C based security encryption either.

==== exmaples
----
exec saveFile(name=>'g4.txt', contents=>'e1,e2,e3\n1,one,1.0\n2,two,2.0');
----

=== deleteFile(...)

Delete the named object from the bucket. 

[source,sql]
----
call deleteFile(string name NOT NULL, string bucket, string region, string endpoint, string accesskey, string secretkey)
----

==== examples
----
exec deleteFile(name=>'myfile.txt');
----

=== list(...)

Lists the contents of the bucket. 

[source,sql]
----
call list(string bucket, string region, string accesskey, string secretkey, nexttoken string) 
    returns Table(result clob)
----

The result is the XML file that Amazon S3 provides in following format

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>/n
<ListBucketResult
    xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
    <Name>teiidbucket</Name>
    <Prefix></Prefix>
    <KeyCount>1</KeyCount>
    <MaxKeys>1000</MaxKeys>
    <IsTruncated>false</IsTruncated>
    <Contents>
        <Key>g2.txt</Key>
        <LastModified>2017-08-08T16:53:19.000Z</LastModified>
        <ETag>&quot;fa44a7893b1735905bfcce59d9d9ae2e&quot;</ETag>
        <Size>48</Size>
        <StorageClass>STANDARD</StorageClass>
    </Contents>
</ListBucketResult>
---- 

You can parse this into view using a example query like below

[source,sql]
----
select b.* from (exec list(bucket=>'mybucket', region=>'us-east-1')) as a, 
 XMLTABLE(XMLNAMESPACES(DEFAULT 'http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/'), '/ListBucketResult/Contents' 
 PASSING XMLPARSE(CONTENT a.result WELLFORMED) COLUMNS Key string, LastModified string, ETag string, Size string, 
 StorageClass string,	NextContinuationToken string PATH '../NextContinuationToken') as b;
---- 

When all properties like bucket, region, accesskey and secretkey are defined as translator override properties one can also issue simply

----
SELECT * FROM Bucket
---- 

Note: if there are more then 1000 object in the bucket, then the value 'NextContinuationToken' need to be supplied as 'nexttoken' into the _list_ call to fetch the next batch of objects. This can be automated in Teiid with enhancement request.
