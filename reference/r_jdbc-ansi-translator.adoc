= JDBC ANSI translator (jdbc-ansi)

Also see common xref:jdbc-translators[JDBC Translators] information.

The JDBC ANSI translator, known by the type name *_jdbc-ansi_*, works with most of the SQL constructs used in {{ book.productnameFull }}, 
except for row LIMIT/OFFSET and EXCEPT/INTERSECT. 
It translates source SQL into ANSI compliant syntax. 
This translator should be used when another more specific type is not available. 
If source exceptions arise due to the use of incompatible SQL constructs, then consider using the xref:jdbc-simple-translator[JDBC simple translator] 
to further restrict capabilities, or create a custom translator.
