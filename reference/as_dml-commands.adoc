You can use SQL in {{ book.productnameFull }} to issue queries and define view transformations. 
For more information about how SQL is used in virtual procedures and update procedures, 
see xref:procedure-language[Procedure language]. 
Nearly all these features follow standard SQL syntax and functionality, so you can use any SQL reference for more information.

There are 4 basic commands for manipulating data in SQL, corresponding to the create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations: 
INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. 
A MERGE statement acts as a combination of INSERT and UPDATE.

You can also execute procedures by using the EXECUTE command, procedural relational command. 
For more information, see xref:procedural-relational-command[Procedural relational command],
or xref:anonymous-procedure-block[Anonymous procedure block].
