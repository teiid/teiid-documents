= Scalar functions

{{ book.productnameFull }} provides an extensive set of built-in scalar functions. 
For more information, see xref:dml-commands[DML commands] and xref:datatypes[Data types]. 
In addition, {{ book.productnameFull }} provides the capability for user-defined functions or UDFs. 
For information about adding UDFs, see _User-defined functions_ in the Translator Development Guide. 
After you add UDFs, you can call them in the same way that you call other functions.
