= Netezza translator (netezza)

Also see common xref:jdbc-translators[JDBC translators] information.

The Netezza translator, known by the type name *_netezza_*, is for use with any version of the IBM Netezza appliance.

.Usage
The current vendor-supplied JDBC driver for Netezza performs poorly with single transactional updates. 
It is best to perform batched updates whenever possible.

.Execution properties
Netezza-specific execution properties:

SqlExtensionsInstalled:: Indicates that SQL extensions, including the ability to process Netezza `REGEXP_LIKE` functions, are installed. 
All other REGEXP functions are then available as pushdown functions. 
Defaults to `false`.
