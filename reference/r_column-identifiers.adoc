= Column Identifiers

Column identifiers are used to specify the output columns in SELECT statements, the 
columns and their values for INSERT and UPDATE statements, and criteria used in WHERE 
and FROM clauses. They are also used in GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses. The syntax 
for column identifiers was defined in the Identifiers section above.
