= Runtime types

{{ book.productnameFull }} works with a core set of runtime types. 
Runtime types can be different from semantic types that are defined in type fields at design time. 
The runtime type can also be specified at design time or it will be automatically chosen as the closest base type to the semantic type.

NOTE: Even if a type is declared with a length, precision, or scale argument, those restrictions are 
effectively ignored by the runtime system, but may be enforced/reported at the edge by OData, ODBC, JDBC. 
Geospatial types act in a similar manner. Extension metadata might be needed for SRID, type, and number 
of dimensions for consumption by tools/OData, but it is not yet enforced. In some instances you might need 
to use the ST_SETSRID function to ensure the SRID is associated.

|Type |Description |Java runtime class |JDBC type |ODBC type

|string or varchar
|Variable length character string with a maximum length of 4000.
|java.lang.String
|VARCHAR
|VARCHAR

|varbinary
|Variable length binary string with a nominal maximum length of 8192.
|byte[] [1]
|VARBINARY
|VARBINARY

|char
|A single 16 bit character - which cannot represent a value beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane. 
This limitation also applies to functions/expressions that expect a single character such as trim, textagg, texttable, and like escape.

|===

1. The runtime type is org.teiid.core.types.BinaryType. Translators will need to explicitly handle BinaryType values. 
UDFs will instead have a byte[] value passed. 
2. The concrete type is expected to be org.teiid.core.types.BlobType 
3. The concrete type is expected to be org.teiid.core.types.ClobType 
4. The concrete type is expected to be org.teiid.core.types.XMLType 
5. The concrete type is expected to be org.teiid.core.types.GeometryType
6. The concrete type is expected to be org.teiid.core.types.GeographyType
7. The concrete type is expected to be org.teiid.core.types.JsonType

NOTE: Character, String, and character large objects (CLOB) types are not limited to ASCII/extended ASCII values. 
Character can hold codes up to 2^16-1 and String/CLOB can hold any value.

.Arrays

An array of any type is designated by adding [] for each array dimension to the type declaration.

.Example: Array types

[source,sql]
----
string[]
----

[source,sql]
----
integer[][]
----

NOTE: Array handling is typically in memory. 
It is not advisable to rely on the usage of large array values. 
Arrays of large objects (LOBs) are typically not handled correctly when serialized.
