= Set operations

You can use the SQL `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` set operations in {{ book.productnameFull }} to combine the results of query expressions.

.Usage:

[source,sql]
----
queryExpression (UNION|INTERSECT|EXCEPT) [ALL] queryExpression [ORDER BY...]
----

.Syntax Rules:

* The output columns will be named by the output columns of the first set operation branch.
* Each `SELECT` must have the same number of output columns and compatible data types for each relative column. 
Data type conversion is performed if data types are inconsistent and implicit conversions exist.
* If `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, or `EXCEPT` is specified without `all`, then the output columns must be comparable types.
* You cannot use the SQL `INTERSECT ALL` or `EXCEPT ALL` operators.
