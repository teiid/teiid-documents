= Query plans

When integrating information using a federated query planner it is useful to view the query plans 
to better understand how information is being accessed and processed, and to troubleshoot problems.

A query plan (also known as an execution or processing plan) is a set of instructions created 
by a query engine for executing a command submitted by a user or application. 
The purpose of the query plan is to execute the user’s query in as efficient a way as possible.

.Getting a query plan

You can get a query plan any time you execute a command. 
The following SQL options are available:

*SET SHOWPLAN [ON|DEBUG]*- Returns the processing plan or the plan and the full planner debug log.
For more information, see _Reading a debug plan_ in xref:query-planner[Query planner] and _SET statement_ in the Client Developer's Guide.
//insert link to Client guide
With the above options, the query plan is available from the Statement object by casting 
to the `org.teiid.jdbc.TeiidStatement` interface or by using the SHOW PLAN statement. For more information, 
see _SHOW Statement_ in the Client Developer's Guide. 
Alternatively you may use the EXPLAIN statement. For more information, see, xref:explain-statements[Explain statement].

.Analyzing a query plan

After you obtain a query plan, you can examine it for the following items:

* Source pushdown -- What parts of the query that got pushed to each source
** Ensure that any predicates especially against indexes are pushed

* Joins -- As federated joins can be quite expensive
** Join ordering -- Typically influenced by costing
** Join criteria type mismatches.
** Join algorithm used -- Merge, enhanced merge, nested loop, and so forth.

* Presence of federated optimizations, such as dependent joins.

* Ensure hints have the desired affects. For more information about using hints, see the following additional 
resources:
** _Hints and Options_ in the Caching Guide.
//insert link to Caching Guide
** _FROM clause hints_ in xref:from-clause[FROM clause].
** xref:subquery-optimization[Subquery optimization].
** xref:federated-optimizations[Federated optimizations].

You can determine all of information in the preceding list from the processing plan. You will typically 
be interested in analyzing the textual form of the final processing plan. To understand why 
particular decisions are made for debugging or support you will want to obtain the full debug 
log which will contain the intermediate planning steps as well as annotations as to why specific pushdown decisions are made.

A query plan consists of a set of nodes organized in a tree structure. If you are executing 
a procedure, the overall query plan will contain additional information related the surrounding procedural execution.

In a procedural context the ordering of child nodes implies the order of execution. 
In most other situation, child nodes may be executed in any order even in parallel. Only in specific 
optimizations, such as dependent join, will the children of a join execute serially.

.Relational query plans

Relational plans represent the processing plan that is composed of nodes representing building blocks 
of logical relational operations. Relational processing plans differ from logical debug relational 
plans in that they will contain additional operations and execution specifics that were chosen by the optimizer.

The nodes for a relational query plan are:

* Access -- Access a source. A source query is sent to the connection factory associated with the source. 
(For a dependent join, this node is called Dependent Access.)
* Dependent procedure access -- Access a stored procedure on a source using multiple sets of input values.
* Batched update -- Processes a set of updates as a batch.
* Project -- Defines the columns returned from the node. This does not alter the number of records returned.
* Project into -- Like a normal project, but outputs rows into a target table.
* Insert plan execution -- Similar to a project into, but executes a plan rather than a source query. 
Typically created when executing an insert into view with a query expression.
* Window function project -- Like a normal project, but includes window functions.
* Select -- Select is a criteria evaluation filter node (WHERE / HAVING).
* Join -- Defines the join type, join criteria, and join strategy (merge or nested loop).
* Union all -- There are no properties for this node, it just passes rows through from it’s children. 
Depending upon other factors, such as if there is a transaction or the source query concurrency allowed, 
not all of the union children will execute in parallel.
* Sort -- Defines the columns to sort on, the sort direction for each column, and whether to remove duplicates or not.
* Dup remove -- Removes duplicate rows. The processing uses a tree structure to detect duplicates so 
that results will effectively stream at the cost of IO operations.
* Grouping -- Groups sets of rows into groups and evaluates aggregate functions.
* Null -- A node that produces no rows. Usually replaces a Select node where the criteria is 
always false (and whatever tree is underneath). There are no properties for this node.
* Plan execution -- Executes another sub plan. Typically the sub plan will be a non-relational plan.
* Dependent procedure execution -- Executes a sub plan using multiple sets of input values.
* Limit -- Returns a specified number of rows, then stops processing. Also processes an offset if present.
* XML table -- Evaluates XMLTABLE. The debug plan will contain more information about the XQuery/XPath 
with regards to their optimization. For more information, see xref:xquery-optimization[XQuery optimization].
* Text table - Evaluates TEXTTABLE
* Array table - Evaluates ARRAYTABLE
* Object table - Evaluates OBJECTTABLE

.Node statistics

Every node has a set of statistics that are output. These can be used to determine the amount 
of data flowing through the node. Before execution a processor plan will not contain node statistics. 
Also the statistics are updated as the plan is processed, so typically you’ll want the 
final statistics after all rows have been processed by the client.

|===
|Statistic |Description |Units

|Node output rows
|Number of records output from the node.
|count

|Node next batch process time
|Time processing in this node only.
|millisec

|Node cumulative next batch process time
|Time processing in this node + child nodes.
|millisec

|Node cumulative process time
|Elapsed time from beginning of processing to end.
|millisec

|Node next batch calls
|Number of times a node was called for processing.
|count

|Node blocks
|Number of times a blocked exception was thrown by this node or a child.
|count
|===

In addition to node statistics, some nodes display cost estimates computed at the node.

|===
|Cost Estimates |Description |Units

|Estimated node cardinality
|Estimated number of records that will be output from the node; -1 if unknown.
|count
|===

The root node will display additional information.

|===
|Top level statistics |Description |Units

|Data Bytes Sent
|The size of the serialized data result (row and lob values) sent to the client.
|bytes
|===

.Reading a processor plan

The query processor plan can be obtained in a plain text or XML format. The plan text 
format is typically easier to read, while the XML format is easier to process by tooling. 
When possible tooling should be used to examine the plans as the tree structures can be deeply nested.

Data flows from the leafs of the tree to the root. Sub plans for procedure execution 
can be shown inline, and are differentiated by different indentation. Given a user query of 
`SELECT pm1.g1.e1, pm1.g2.e2, pm1.g3.e3 from pm1.g1 inner join (pm1.g2 left outer join pm1.g3 on pm1.g2.e1=pm1.g3.e1) on pm1.g1.e1=pm1.g3.e1`, 
the text for a processor plan that does not push down the joins would look like:

[source,xml]

----

Note that the nested join node is using a merge join and expects the source queries 
from each side to produce the expected ordering for the join. The parent join is an 
enhanced sort join which can delay the decision to perform sorting based upon the incoming rows. 
Note that the outer join from the user query has been modified to an inner join since none 
of the null inner values can be present in the query result.

The preceding plan can also be represented in in XML format as in the following example:

.Other plans

Procedure execution (including instead of triggers) use intermediate and final plan forms 
that include relational plans. Generally the structure of the XML/procedure plans will 
closely match their logical forms. It’s the nested relational plans that will be of interest when analyzing performance issues.
