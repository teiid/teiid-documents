.Execution properties

|===
|Name |Description |Default

|MaxBulkInsertBatchSize
|Batch Size to use to insert bulk inserts.
|2048

|SupportsGroupBy
|Enables `GROUP BY` Pushdown. Set to false to have {{ book.productnameFull }} process group by aggregations, 
such as those returning more than 2000 rows which error in SOQL.
|true
|===

The Salesforce translator can import metadata.

.Import properties

|===
|Property Name |Description |Required |Default

|NormalizeNames
|If the importer should attempt to modify the object/field names so that they can be used unquoted.
|false
|true

|excludeTables
|A case-insensitive regular expression that when matched against a table name will exclude it from import. 
Applied after table names are retrieved. Use a negative look-ahead (?!<inclusion pattern>).* to act as an inclusion filter.
|false
|n/a

|includeTables
|A case-insensitive regular expression that when matched against a table name will be included during import. 
Applied after table names are retrieved from source.
|false
|n/a

|importStatstics
|Retrieves cardinalities during import using the REST API explain plan feature.
|false
|false

|ModelAuditFields
|Add Audit Fields To Model.  This includes CreatedXXX, LastModifiedXXX, and SystemModstamp fields.
|false
|false
|===

NOTE： When both _includeTables_ and _excludeTables_ patterns are present during the import, 
the _includeTables_ pattern matched first, then the _excludePatterns_ will be applied.

NOTE: If you need connectivity to an API version other than what is built in, you may 
try to use an existing connectivity pair, but in some circumstances - especially 
accessing a later remote api from an older Java API - this is not possible and results 
in what appears to be hung connections. 

.Extension metadata properties
Salesforce is not relational database, however {{ book.productnameFull }} provides ways to map Saleforce data into relational constructs like Tables and Procedures. 
You can define a foreign table using DDL in {{ book.productnameFull }} VDB, which maps to Salesforce's SObject. 
At runtime, to interpret this table back to a SObject, {{ book.productnameFull }} decorates or tags this table definition with additional metadata. 
For example, a table is defined as in the following example:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE Pricebook2 (
	Id string, 
	Name string, 
	IsActive boolean, 
	IsStandard boolean, 
	Description string, 
	IsDeleted boolean) 
	OPTIONS (
	  UPDATABLE 'TRUE', 
	  "teiid_sf:Supports Query" 'TRUE');
----

In the preceding example, the property in the `OPTIONS` clause with the property `"teiid_sf:Supports Query"` set to `TRUE` indicates that 
you can run `SELECT` commands against this table. The following table lists the metadata extension properties that can be used in a Salesforce schema.

|===
|Property Name |Description |Required |Default| Applies To

|Supports Query
|You can run `SELECT` commands against the table.
|false
|true
|Table

|Supports Retrieve
|You can retrieve the results of `SELECT` commands run against the table.
|false
|true
|Table

|===


.SQL processing

Salesforce does not provide the same set of functionality as a relational database. 
For example, Salesforce does not support arbitrary joins between tables. 
However, working in combination with the {{ book.productnameFull }} Query Planner, 
the Salesforce connector can use nearly all of the SQL syntax capabilities in {{ book.productnameFull }}.
The Salesforce Connector executes SQL commands by "pushing down" the command to Salesforce 
whenever possible, depending on the available capabilities. {{ book.productnameFull }} will automatically 
provide additional database functionality when the Salesforce Connector does not explicitly enable use of a given SQL construct. 
In cases where certain SQL capabilities cannot be pushed down to Salesforce, {{ book.productnameFull }} will push down the capabilities that it can, 
and fetch a set of data from Salesforce. Then, {{ book.productnameFull }} will evaluate the additional capabilities, 
creating a subset of the original data set. 
Finally, {{ book.productnameFull }} will pass the result to the client.

If you issue queries with a `GROUP BY` clause, and you receive a Salesforce error that indicates that `queryMore` is not supported, 
you can either add limits, or set the execution property `SupportsGroupBy` to `false`.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT array_agg(Reports) FROM Supervisor where Division = 'customer support';
----

Neither Salesforce, nor the Salesforce Connector support the `array_agg()` scalar. 
however, both are compatible with the `CompareCriteriaEquals` query, so the connector transforms the query that it receives into this query to Salesforce.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT Reports FROM Supervisor where Division = 'customer support';
----

The array_agg() function will be applied by the {{ book.productnameFull }} Query Engine to the result set returned by the connector.

In some cases, multiple calls to the Salesforce application will be made to process the SQL that is passed to the connector.

[source,sql]
----
DELETE From Case WHERE Status = 'Closed';
----

The API in Salesforce to delete objects can delete by object ID only. In order to accomplish this, 
the Salesforce connector will first execute a query to get the IDs of the correct objects, and then delete those objects. 
So the above DELETE command will result in the following two commands.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT ID From Case WHERE Status = 'Closed';
DELETE From Case where ID IN (<result of query>);
----

NOTE： The Salesforce API DELETE call is not expressed in SQL, but the above is an equivalent SQL expression.

It’s useful to be aware of incompatible capabilities, in order to avoid fetching large data sets from Salesforce and making you queries as performant as possible. 
For information about the SQL constructs that you can push down to Salesforce, see xref:compatible-sql-capabilities[].

.Selecting from multi-select picklists

A multi-select picklist is a field type in Salesforce that can contain multiple values in a single field. 
Query criteria operators for fields of this type in SOQL are limited to EQ, NE, includes and excludes. 
For the Salesforce documentation about how to select from multi-select picklists, 
see http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/soql_sosl/Content/sforce_api_calls_soql_querying_multiselect_picklists.htm[Querying Multi-select Picklists]

{{ book.productnameFull }} SQL does not support the includes or excludes operators, but the Salesforce 
connector provides user-defined function definitions for these operators that provide equivalent functionality for fields of type multi-select. 
The definition for the functions is:

[source,sql]
----
boolean includes(Column column, String param)
boolean excludes(Column column, String param)
----

For example, take a single multi-select picklist column called Status that contains all of these values.

* current
* working
* critical

For that column, all of the below are valid queries:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM Issue WHERE true = includes (Status, 'current, working' );
SELECT * FROM Issue WHERE true = excludes (Status, 'current, working' );
SELECT * FROM Issue WHERE true = includes (Status, 'current;working, critical' );
----

EQ and NE criteria will pass to Salesforce as supplied. For example, these queries will not be modified by the connector.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM Issue WHERE Status = 'current';
SELECT * FROM Issue WHERE Status = 'current;critical';
SELECT * FROM Issue WHERE Status != 'current;working';
----

.Selecting all objects

You can use the Salesforce connector to call the `queryAll` operation from the Salesforce API. 
The `queryAll` operation is equivalent to the query operation with the exception that it returns data about all current and deletedobjects in the system.

The connector determines if it will call the query or `queryAll` operation via reference to the `isDeleted` property 
present on each Salesforce object, and modeled as a column on each table generated by the importer. 
By default this value is set to `false` when the model is generated and thus the connector calls query. 
Users are free to change the value in the model to `true`, changing the default behavior of the connector to be `queryAll`.

The behavior is different if `isDeleted` is used as a parameter in the query. 
If the `isDeleted` column is used as a parameter in the query, and the value is `true`, then the connector calls `queryAll`.

[source,sql]
----
select * from Contact where isDeleted = true;
----

If the `isDeleted` column is used as a parameter in the query, and the value is `false`, then the connector that performs the default behavior will call the query.

[source,sql]
----
select * from Contact where isDeleted = false;
----

.Selecting updated objects

If the option is selected when importing metadata from Salesforce, a GetUpdated procedure is generated in the model with the following structure:

[source,sql]
----
GetUpdated (ObjectName IN string,
    StartDate IN datetime,
    EndDate IN datetime,
    LatestDateCovered OUT datetime)
returns
    ID string
----

See the description of the http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/sforce_api_calls_getupdated.htm[GetUpdated] 
operation in the Salesforce documentation for usage details.

.Selecting deleted objects

If the option is selected when importing metadata from Salesforce, a GetDeleted procedure is generated in the model with the following structure:

[source,sql]
----
GetDeleted (ObjectName IN string,
    StartDate IN datetime,
    EndDate IN datetime,
    EarliestDateAvailable OUT datetime,
    LatestDateCovered OUT datetime)
returns
    ID string,
    DeletedDate datetime
----

See the description of the http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/sforce_api_calls_getdeleted.htm[GetDeleted] 
operation in the Salesforce documentation for usage details.

.Relationship queries

Unlike a relational database, Salesforce does not support join operations, but it does have support for queries that include 
parent-to-child or child-to-parent relationships between objects. These are termed Relationship Queries. 
You can run Relationship Queries in the SalesForce connector through Outer Join syntax.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT Account.name, Contact.Name from Contact LEFT OUTER JOIN Account
on Contact.Accountid = Account.id
----

This query shows the correct syntax to query a SalesForce model with to produce a relationship query from child to parent. 
It resolves to the following query to SalesForce.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT Contact.Account.Name, Contact.Name FROM Contact
----

[source,sql]
----
select Contact.Name, Account.Name from Account Left outer Join Contact
on Contact.Accountid = Account.id
----

This query shows the correct syntax to query a SalesForce model with to produce a relationship query from 
parent to child. It resolves to the following query to SalesForce.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT Account.Name, (SELECT Contact.Name FROM
Account.Contacts) FROM Account
----

See the description of the http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/index_Left.htm#StartTopic=Content/sforce_api_calls_soql_relationships.htm[Relationship Queries] 
operation in the SalesForce documentation for limitations.

.Bulk insert queries

You can also use bulk insert statements in the SalesForce translator by using JDBC batch semantics or SELECT INTO semantics. 
The batch size is determined by the execution property _MaxBulkInsertBatchSize_, which can be overridden in the vdb file. 
The default value of the batch is 2048. The bulk insert feature uses the async REST based API exposed by Salesforce for execution for better performance.

.Bulk selects

When querying tables with more than 10,000,000 records, or if experiencing timeouts with just result batching, 
{{ book.productnameFull }} can issue queries to Salesforce using the bulk API. 
When using a bulk select, primary key (PK) chunking is enabled if it is compatible with the query.

The use of the bulk api requires a source hint in the query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT /*+ sh salesforce:'bulk' */ Name ... FROM Account
----

Where salesforce is the source name of the target source.

The default chunk size of 100,000 records will be used. 

NOTE: This feature is only supported in the Salesforce API version 28 or higher.

[id="compatible-sql-capabilities"]
.Compatible SQL capabilities

You ca use the following SQL capabilities with the Salesforce Connector. 
These SQL constructs will be pushed down to Salesforce.

* SELECT command
* INSERT Command
* UPDATE Command
* DELETE Command
* NotCriteria
* OrCriteria
* CompareCriteriaEquals
* CompareCriteriaOrdered
* IsNullCritiera
* InCriteria
* LikeCriteria - Can be used for String fields only.
* RowLimit
* Basic Aggregates
* OuterJoins with join criteria KEY

.Native Queries

Salesforce procedures may optionally have native queries associated with them. For more information, 
see _Parameterizable native queries_ in xref:translators[Translators]. 
The operation prefix (select;, insert;, update;, delete; - see below for more) must be present 
in the native-query, but it will not be issued as part of the query to the source.

[source,sql]
.*Example DDL for a Salesforce native procedure*
----
CREATE FOREIGN PROCEDURE proc (arg1 integer, arg2 string) OPTIONS ("teiid_rel:native-query" 'search;SELECT ... complex SOQL ... WHERE col1 = $1 and col2 = $2') 
returns (col1 string, col2 string, col3 timestamp);
----

.Direct query procedure

This feature is turned off by default because of the security risk this exposes to execute any command against the source. 
To enable direct query procedures, set the execution property called `SupportsDirectQueryProcedure` to `true`. For more information, 
see _Override the execution properties_ in xref:Translators[].

TIP: By default the name of the procedure that executes the queries directly is called *native*. For information about how to change the 
default name, see _Override the execution properties_ in xref:Translators[].

The Salesforce translator provides a procedure to execute any ad-hoc SOQL query directly 
against the source without {{ book.productnameFull }} parsing or resolving. Since the metadata of 
this procedure’s results are not known to {{ book.productnameFull }}, they are returned as an object array. 
xref:arraytable[ARRAYTABLE] can be used construct tabular output for consumption by client applications. 
{{ book.productnameFull }} exposes this procedure with a simple query structure as follows:

.Select

[source,sql]
.*Select example*
----
SELECT x.* FROM (call sf_source.native('search;SELECT Account.Id, Account.Type, Account.Name FROM Account')) w,
 ARRAYTABLE(w.tuple COLUMNS "id" string , "type" string, "name" String) AS x
----

from the above code, the "search" keyword followed by a query statement.

NOTE: The SOQL is treated as a parameterized native query so that parameter values may be inserted in the query 
string properly. For more information, see _Parameterizable native queries_ in xref:translators[Translators]. 
The results returned by search may contain the object Id as the first column value regardless of whether it was selected. 
Also queries that select columns from multiple object types will not be correct.

.Delete

[source,sql]
.*Delete Example*
----
SELECT x.* FROM (call sf_source.native('delete;', 'id1', 'id2')) w,
 ARRAYTABLE(w.tuple COLUMNS "updatecount" integer) AS x
----

form the above code, the "delete;" keyword followed by the ids to delete as varargs.

.Create or update

[source,sql]
.*Create example*
----
SELECT x.* FROM
 (call sf_source.native('create;type=table;attributes=one,two,three', 'one', 2, 3.0)) w,
 ARRAYTABLE(w.tuple COLUMNS "update_count" integer) AS x
----

form the above code, the "create" or "update" keyword must be followed by the following properties. 
Attributes must be matched positionally by the procedure variables - thus in the example attribute two will be set to 2.

|===
|Property Name |Description |Required

|type
|Table Name
|Yes

|attributes
|comma separated list of names of the columns
|no
|===

The values for each attribute is specified as separate argument to the "native" procedure.

Update is similar to create, with one more extra property called "id", which defines identifier for the record.

[source,sql]
.*Update example*
----
SELECT x.* FROM
 (call sf_source.native('update;id=pk;type=table;attributes=one,two,three', 'one', 2, 3.0)) w,
 ARRAYTABLE(w.tuple COLUMNS "update_count" integer) AS x
----

TIP: By default the name of the procedure that executes the queries directly is called native, 
however you can add set an override execution property in the DDL file to change it.
