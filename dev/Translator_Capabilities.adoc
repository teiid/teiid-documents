= Translator Capabilities

The `ExecutionFactory` class defines all the methods that describe the capabilities of a Translator. These are used by the Connector Manager to determine what kinds of commands the translator is capable of executing. A base `ExecutionFactory` class implements all the basic capabilities methods, which says your translator does not support any capabilities. Your extended `ExecutionFactory` class must override the the necessary methods to specify which capabilities your translator supports.  You should consult the debug log of query planning (set showplan debug) to see if desired pushdown requires additional capabilities.

== Capability Scope

Note capabilities are determined and cached for the lifetime of the translator. Capabilities based on connection/user are not supported.

== Capabilities

The following table lists the capabilities that can be specified in the `ExecutionFactory` class.

.*Available Capabilities*

|===

Note that any pushdown subquery must itself be compliant with the Translator capabilities.

== Command Form

The method `ExecutionFactory.useAnsiJoin()` should return true if the Translator prefers the use of ANSI style join structure for join trees that contain only INNER and CROSS joins.

The method `ExecutionFactory.requiresCriteria()` should return true if the Translator requires criteria for any Query, Update, or Delete. This is a replacement for the model support property `Where All`.

== Scalar Functions

The method `ExecutionFactory.getSupportedFunctions()` can be used to specify which system/user defined scalar and user defined aggregate functions the Translator supports. The constants interface `org.teiid.translator.SourceSystemFunctions` contains the string names of all possible built-in pushdown functions, which includes the four standard math operators: +, -, *, and /.

Not all system functions appear in SourceSystemFunctions, since some system functions will always be evaluated in Teiid, are simple aliases to other functions, or are rewritten to a more standard expression.

This documentation for system functions can be found at link:../reference/Scalar_Functions.adoc[Scalar Functions]. If the Translator states that it supports a function, it must support all type combinations and overloaded forms of that function.

A translator may also indicate support for scalar functions that are intended for pushdown evaluation by that translator, but are not registered as user defined functions via a model/schema.  These pushdown
functions are reported to the engine via the `ExecutionFactory.getPushDownFunctions()` list as `FunctionMethod` metadata objects. The `FuncitonMethod` representation allow the translator to control all of the metadata related to the function, including type signature, determinism, varargs, etc. The simplest way to add a pushdown function is with a call to `ExecutionFactory.addPushDownFunction`:

[source,java]
----
FunctionMethod addPushDownFunction(String qualifier, String name, String returnType, String...paramTypes)
----

This resulting function will be known as sys.qualifier.name, but can be called with just name as long as the function name is unique. The returned `FunctionMethod` object may be further manipulated depending upon the needs of the source. An example of adding a custom concat vararg function in an `ExecutionFactory` subclass:

[source,java]
----
public void start() throws TranslatorException {
  super.start();
  FunctionMethod func = addPushDownFunction("oracle", "concat", "string", "string", "string");
  func.setVarArgs(true);
  ...
}
----

== Physical Limits

The method `ExecutionFactory.getMaxInCriteriaSize()` can be used to specify the maximum number of values that can be passed in an IN criteria.  This is an important constraint as an IN criteria is frequently used to pass criteria between one source and another using a dependent join.

The method `ExecutionFactory.getMaxDependentInPredicates()` is used to specify the maximum number of IN predicates (of at most MaxInCriteriaSize) that can be passed as part of a dependent join. For example if there are 10000 values to pass as part of the dependent join and a MaxInCriteriaSize of 1000 and a MaxDependentInPredicates setting of 5, then the dependent join logic will form two source queries each with 5 IN predicates of 1000 values each combined by OR.

The method `ExecutionFactory.getMaxFromGroups()` can be used to specify the maximum number of FROM Clause groups that can used in a join. -1 indicates there is no limit.

== Update Execution Modes

The method `ExecutionFactory.supportsBatchedUpdates()` can be used to indicate that the Translator supports executing the `BatchedUpdates` command.

The method `ExecutionFactory.supportsBulkUpdate()` can be used to indicate that the Translator accepts update commands containg multi valued Literals.

Note that if the translator does not support either of these update modes, the query engine will compensate by issuing the updates individually.

== Default Behavior

The method `ExecutionFactory.getDefaultNullOrder()` specifies the default null order. Can be one of UNKNOWN, LOW, HIGH, FIRST, LAST. This is only used if ORDER BY is supported, but null ordering is not.

The method `ExecutionFactory.getCollation()` specifies the default collation. If set to a value that does not match the collation locale defined by org.teiid.collationLocale, then some ordering may not be pushed down.

The method `ExecutionFactory.getRequiredLikeEscape()` specifies the required like escape character. Used only when a source supports a specific escape.

== Use of Connections

|===
|Method |Description |Default

|is/setSourceRequired
|True indicates a source connection is required for fetching the metadata of the source or executing queries.
|true

|is/setSourceRequiredForMetadata
|True indicates a source connection is required for fetching the metadata of the source.
|SourceRequired
|===

== Transaction Behavior

ExecutionFactory.get/setTransactionSupport specifies the highest level of transaction supported by connections to the source.  This is used as a hint to the engine for deciding when to start a transaction in the autoCommitTxn=DETECT mode.  Defaults to XA.
