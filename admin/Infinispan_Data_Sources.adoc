= Infinispan Data Sources

Infinispan data sources use a Teiid specific JCA connector that is deployed into {{ book.asVersionNumber }} during installation. There are many ways to create a Infinispan hotrod based data source, using CLI, link:AdminShell.adoc[AdminShell],
admin-console, etc. The example shown below uses the CLI tool, as this works in both Standalone and Domain modes.

Execute the following command using the {{ book.asDocRoot }}/Admin+Guide#AdminGuide-RunningtheCLI[CLI] once you connected to the Server. Make sure you provide the correct URL and user credentials. Add any additional properties required by the connector by duplicating the "connection-definitions" command below. Edit the JNDI name to match the JNDI name you used in VDB.

TIP: *Developerâ€™s Tip* - If {{ book.asVersionNumber }} is running in standalone mode, you can also manually edit the "<jboss-install>/standalone/configuration/standalone-teiid.xml" file and add the XML configuration defined in *"<jboss-install>/docs/teiid/datasources/infinispan"* directory under "resource-adapters" subsystem. Shutdown the server before you edit this file, and restart after the modifications are done.
